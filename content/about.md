Who am I? Nobody really.

Like many others, I was fascinated by video games at a young age.
It was hard to imagine how a box plugged into the TV could create such amazing experiences almost living within their own world.
This interest led me down many paths, from learning QBASIC, to moving onto languages like C and C++ which were the defacto standard for video games at the time.
I struggled with bugs, poor design patterns, and other pitfalls of self-taught programmers, but I learned a ton and I would do it all over again if given the chance.

For better or for worse, I eventually shifted focus towards web technology, Linux, backend server-side systems, automation, and "cloud" technology.
Experiencing the change from on-premise servers to fully hosted infrastructure with multiple levels of automation and "infrastructure as code" has been interesting,
but my true passion still lies with video games, and I continue to enjoy working on games and game technology in my spare time.

Outside of computers and technology I have other hobbies, but this website is mainly focused on technology and some of my thoughts and discoveries about it.
Anyway, thanks for visiting my small bite of the internet. :)
